# Group Project: To-Do List App with JavaScript and Local Storage<br>
Welcome to our group project! We've created a to-do list application using JavaScript and integrated local storage for seamless task management and persistence.

**Project Description**<br>
Our to-do list app is designed to simplify your task management. It allows you to add,mark tasks as completed, and delete them, all while ensuring your to-do list is automatically saved to local storage for continued access even after closing your browser.

**Features**<br>
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.<br>
Complete Tasks: Mark tasks as completed.<br>
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks when they're no longer needed.<br>
Local Storage: Your to-do list is saved in local storage, so your tasks are retained between sessions.<br>

**How It Works**<br>
To add a new task, simply enter a description in the input field and press "Add Task."<br>
You can mark it as completed by clicking the checkbox, or delete it by clicking the "Delete" icon.

Your to-do list is automatically saved to local storage, so your tasks will persist even if you close and reopen the app.<br>
